# [JPT] Human Resources!
A technology overhaul for RimWorld 

[**>>> DOWNLOAD IT HERE <<<**](https://github.com/jptrrs/HumanResources/releases/latest)

_So, the brainiac in your colony spent a whole week locked up in his lab and discovered solar power. Great! Now, how exactly do the builder figures out how to actually build the damn solar panels? Or else: your hunter has been using only bow and arrow for his whole life, so how the heck is he going to operate the space-age pulse charger you just gave him? How can someone grow peaches if he's never seen a peach tree before? Craft a full armor set without knowing how to smith? **What if your pawns had to actually learn their stuff before putting a new technology to use?**_

This experimental mod with far-reaching consequences completely changes the way research plays out in the game. No longer some abstract concept, technologies become actual knowledge your pawns need to learn from methodical research, by studying the proper books (yes, you get to build a library!) or, when it comes to weapons skills, to be acquired by arduous training (yes, you get to build a dojo!). Proper knowledge of what they're doing will be mandatory for them to build and repair structures, follow recipes, grow crops and equip weapons. **This will make you care a lot more for your colonists and give you a whole new perspective on recruiting**. It will also raise new obstacles to developing your colony, making the game harder but also adding gameplay depth. We hope you're up to the challenge!

#### Warning #1: Not suited to be added mid-game. 
Please, start a new one.

#### Warning #2: This mod relies on [ResearchTree](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1266570759) (or its branch, [ResearchPal](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=946390822)). 
If you don't use one of them yet, what are you doing with your life? They're pretty much mandatory mods. Please, choose one and install it. We could have incorporated Fluffy's code into ours, but we'd rather mantain a lean mod and give you an incentive to get know and support his work.

#### Warning #3: This is a public test phase for an unifinished mod. 
Expect many issues and incompatibilities. We're counting on your collaboration to identify them and suggest improvements. Bear in mind the final product might be very different, and changes made during this process might break your game. If you're planning on starting a long-term playthrough (and we encourage you to do so, so we can test long-term effects), be prepared to make a local copy to avoid game-breaking updates.

Here are the details on how it works:

## Knowledge is **power.**
Every pawn gets a new inspector tab: _Tech_. It displays everything he or she knows: technological expertise on one side and weapons proficiency on the other. Both lists are derived from the current game database, so all modded research projects and weapons are automatically included. Newly generated pawns, including NPCs, are assigned a number of techs based on his faction tech level and his background. That number depends on a pawn's age and faction level: tribals get more and cheaper techs, and the more advanced their starting level is the more specialized they tend to be. This list limits what a pawn can build, repair, grow or craft. To acquire new knowledge, he or she will need to study! That's one of the uses of the new _study desk_.

The weapon proficiency works similarly, limiting what weapons the pawn can equip. Some weapons are just too simple to use and don't require any special training, so all pawns start with those. Specially good shooters and brawlers get access to all ranged and melee weapons on their tech level, respectively (at the cost of one less tech on their expertise). Additionally, pawns who know how to craft a weapon are automatically proficient with it. Beyond this starting proficiency, any weapon that's linked with a research project will require the pawn to learn how to use it before equipping. To train with a new weapon, that tech must have already been unlocked and the pawn will need to spend some time with the _training dummy_ or at the _target stand_. More on that below.

## Books are **mandatory.**
![books](https://imgur.com/xLgTSL4.png)\
Yes, books! This is how humanity stores and shares knowledge and this is how you're going to store and share your technology now. There's a book for every research project on the game (even modded ones), and you can only unlock a technology when you add that book to your library. Of course, this is RimWorld, so finding useful books is not so easy. You can eventually buy them from the new specialized traders, but that's expensive and they rarely visit. You can maybe get them as a quest reward too. But mostly you'll have to write them yourself, by assinging a colonist to a _document technology_ task on the _study desk_. He will only be able to write about what he knows, of course! This means in order to expand your horizons you'll need to either recruit more talents or do some research!

## Researching is **hard.**
Researching with _**Human Resources**_ is a little different from the base game. Selecting a technology on the research tab will accomplish nothing. Instead, the research benches now function like the other work stations: you set up a bill with the subject to be researched and you can restrict skill levels or even assign individual pawns for the task. Your pawns will come to work if they're assigned to researching, as usual. However, their work no longer outputs to the research project on the main research tab, but to their own individual expertise instead, and it takes a little longer. If the tech you're researching has any pre-requisites, your pawns will only be able to proceed if they already mastered those. On the other hand, if what they are researching is itself a pre-requisite to something they already know, their research speed is doubled.

As you can see, the technology advancemnt for your colony will become it's own **production chain**:

research tech > | document it into a book > | add book to library > | study tech > | do stuff with it.
:---|:---|:---|:---|:---
(research bench)|(study bench)|(book shelf)|(study bench)|(build/repair/grow/craft)

#### To Do: include an option for the hardcore player to forego tech research entirely. 

## Weapon training
The _training dummy_ and the _target stand_ are the facilities for learning to use melee and ranged weapons, respectively. Any weapon will be made avaiable for this once their associated technology is unlocked (_i.e._ added to the library). Pawns must be assigned to learning. 



## Changed Research Benches

Books you buy or write yourself will only count as unlocked technologies when they're stored on a _book shelf_. These constitute your library, and you should take good care of them! After all, a destroyed book literally means

## **Warning:** not suited for conservative players.

**This is not a cosmetic mod!** It was designed to make designing your base a more challenging (and thus, rewarding) task. It gives you as much trouble as benefits, so you must consider the tradeoffs carefully. Windows provide pretty good and flexible defensive positions, but they will also become weak spots on your walls. They provide a free light source during the day, but your colonists will suffer if they are away from it. And they only work if you can place them between interior and exterior spaces, natural light only going as far as the next obstacle is on the other side. For this reason, I don't recommend adding it to a game you already started, even if it doesn't actually require a new savagame. You've been warned! Please don't ask me to nerf it without trying it first!

## Compatibility

You can safely add this to your saved game. About other mods, **we simply cannot test it with every one out there**. All we can do is design for maximum compatibility and hope for the best. If you're unsure, please give it a shot. If you stumble on any problem, let us know and we'll do what we can to fix it. Integrates with:

*   **[Dubs Skylights](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=833899765):** The windows will require _glass panes_. The skylights and the smelt glass recipe will require the _Glassworks_ research (except if also using Maaxar's [Dubs Skylights Glass+Lights Patch](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1610803364) and [Glass+Lights](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=826153738)). Note that light passing through will suffer a 10% level reduction, just like with the windows (you can change this on the mod's option panel).
*   **[Expanded Roofing](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1512478761):** The _Transparent Roof Production_ research now will require the _Glassworks_ research. Its cost was reduced to compensate for that. This means Transparent Roof will only be possible after the windows. As a side effect, transparent roofs no longer produce those ugly shadows! Note that light passing through will suffer a 10% level reduction, just like with the windows (you can change this on the mod's option panel).
*   **[Glass+Lights](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=826153738):** The windows will require _glass_, reinforced windows will require _reinforced glass_. G+L's Glassworks research project replaces the one added by this mod. Also, if G+L is present, it will affect Dubs Skylights: _glass_ replaces _glass panes_ and the _smelt glass_ recipe is removed (this means you no longer need [Dubs Skylights Glass+Lights Patch](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1610803364)).
*   **[Nature is Beautiful [1.0]](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1530259312), [Nature is Beautiful [rebalanced]](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1551147619) & [Beautiful Outdoors](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2011794898):** If one of them is present, the windows will calculate their beauty by summing up the beauty on their field of view. The pawn's sensitivity to beauty will be reduced to compensate (you can change this on the mod's option panel).
*   **[[KV] RimFridge](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1180721235):** Wall refrigerators get the same treatment as the windows, vents and coolers: now they're actually linked to the walls!

Not compatible with:

*   [Star Wars - Fully Functional Lightsabers](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=918200645)
